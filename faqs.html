    <p class="faq-question">What is the required CGWA to graduate with honors?</p>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        The University awards three (3) types of Academic or Latin Honors to qualified students who have completed their bachelor's degree. Each award type is based on the **Cumulative General Weighted Average (CGWA)** of all course grades in the curriculum, except those in all Physical Education and National Service Training Program courses.  
        <br><br>
        Effective **AY 2023-2024**, final grades in the four (4) **Physical Activity Towards Health and Fitness (PATHFit)** courses, with the course codes **MCFIT01X to MCFIT04X**, are included in the CGWA computation.  
        <br><br>
        **The awards and their corresponding CGWA ranges are as follows:**  
        - **Summa Cum Laude** – CGWA **3.75 or higher**  
          - Awarded to students who graduate with the highest distinction for achieving the highest possible grades in their degree.  
        - **Magna Cum Laude** – CGWA **3.50 - 3.74**  
          - Awarded to students who graduate with great distinction, representing the middle tier of honors.  
        - **Cum Laude** – CGWA **3.25 - 3.49**  
          - The lowest level of academic honors awarded to students who graduate with distinction.  
        <br>
        The following guidelines apply to students who enrolled in **AY 2023-2024 onwards (student number from 2023)**. For students enrolled in **AY 2022 or earlier**, the policies in effect when they entered will be applied.  
        <br><br>
        **To qualify for academic honors, a student must:**  
        1) Have a **CGWA of at least 3.25**.  
        2) Have **no Fail (0.0), Repeat (R), Fail for Bridging/Intervention Courses (F), or Officially Dropped (Dr) grades** in any course taken at the University.  
        3) Complete the program **within the prescribed curriculum length**.  
        4) Complete **100% of courses in the curriculum at any National University campus**.  
        5) Have **no record of disciplinary action for committing a major offense** as determined by the Student Discipline Office.  
        <br>
        **For transfer or second-degree students** who choose to take all courses in the curriculum and forego crediting of courses from a previous school or earned degree, the above provisions shall apply.
