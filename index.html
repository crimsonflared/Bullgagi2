            <h2>Group History: The Evolution of BULLGAGI</h2>
            <p>Over time, our community has grown, faced challenges, and adapted to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for students. Below is a brief history of how we arrived at BULLGAGI 2.0.</p>

            <div class="group-container">
                <h3>ASOSASYON ARF - The First Chapter</h3>
                <p><strong>Motto:</strong> "ARF ARF!"</p>
                <p>Asosasyon ARF was the first student group created with the goal of building an interactive and entertaining space for students. It served as a hub for discussions, announcements, and student engagement. However, due to internal circumstances, the original owner decided to pause and eventually archive the group. Out of respect for privacy, the specific reasons remain undisclosed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="group-container">
                <h3>BULLGAGI - A New Beginning</h3>
                <p>After the first group was archived, students and community members sought a fresh start, leading to the creation of BULLGAGI. This group quickly gained traction, becoming an active online space for students to seek help, share insights, and engage in lighthearted discussions. However, due to reported violations, the group was unfortunately suspended, leading to another turning point.</p>

            <div class="group-container">
                <h3>BULLGAGI 2.0 - The Present and Future</h3>
                <p>Determined not to let setbacks define the community, the admins launched <strong>BULLGAGI 2.0</strong>. This version of the group upholds the same mission—to support students—while implementing stricter moderation to ensure compliance with platform guidelines. Today, BULLGAGI 2.0 thrives as a safe and engaging environment for students to learn, grow, and connect.</p>
